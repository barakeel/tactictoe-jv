Deadline: February 15th

Paper: 
1) writing the abstract/introduction/conclusion. (can be done with the current success rates and updated later.)
  This includes a description of how a developper uses HOL4, naturally introducing:
  theories, theorem, tactics, goals and obligations.
2) proof reading for style and grammatical errors section 3-6. One of the Phd student of Josef proposed to do that.
3) proof reading section on proof recording.
4) rerunning experiments in a single setting and commenting on them.
5) commenting on the case study. 

Your help is welcome on points 1 and 3 of this list. And probably a week later, someone will have to proof read and comment points 4 and 5.


Implementation:
[TODO: DONE - added hh_tac.sml to HOL4 repo] 
  Commit progress on replacing/removing OCaml in HOL4 repo
[TODO: DONE] Find a replacement for additionally saved theorems from TacticToe.
[TODO: MN] Execute a modified script with the same file dependencies as the 
  original script + tactictoe dependencies. 
  An example of a modified script is given in this 
  repository (current load commands can/should be removed).
